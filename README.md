# 🌌 Cyber Intelligence Hub

Welcome to the **Quantum-Super Cyber Intelligence Hub**, a world-class cybersecurity management system and intelligence synthesis platform designed for the next generation of digital defense. This hub leverages the power of Gemini AI to monitor, audit, and manifest the future of quantum technology.

## 🚀 Core Features

### 📡 Discovery Registry
A high-fidelity CMS for cataloging quantum inventions and cybersecurity assets. Features deterministic AI analysis, real-time filtering by stability thresholds, and spectral diagnostics.

### 🔴 Global Threat Monitor
Powered by **Gemini Search Grounding**, this module scans the web for the most recent and critical cybersecurity threats, data breaches, and zero-day vulnerabilities reported within the last 48 hours.

### 🛡️ Security Auditor
An AI-driven technical analysis tool. Input your tech specs or code snippets to receive a structured JSON audit covering risk levels, encryption entropy, and specific mitigation protocols.

### 🧪 Synthesis Lab
Utilizes **Gemini 3 Pro** to generate high-quality tactical reports and intelligence briefings based on neural prompts.

### 🎨 Manifestation Hub
Uses the **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image** manifestation engine to physically visualize theoretical quantum machinery and technical schematics from text descriptions.

### 💎 Explorer Core
An interactive upgrade system where researchers can spend "Essence" (earned via audits) to enhance neural vulnerability scanning depth and synthesis logic processing speed.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Routing**: React Router 6
- **AI Intelligence**: Google Gemini API (@google/genai)
  - `gemini-3-flash-preview` for rapid analysis and search.
  - `gemini-3-pro-preview` for deep intelligence synthesis.
  - `gemini-2.5-flash-image` for molecular visual manifestation.
- **Styling**: Cyberpunk-inspired glassmorphism, neon HUD elements, and custom "Quantum" holographic components.

## ⚡ Getting Started

1.  **API Key**: Ensure your Gemini API key is configured in the environment (`process.env.API_KEY`).
2.  **Installation**: The project uses modern ES6 modules via `esm.sh`. No complex build steps required—just serve the `index.html`.
3.  **Core Sync**: Manifest your first asset in the **Manifestation Hub** to populate the registry.

## 📜 Security Protocol
This application is for authorized intelligence personnel only. All neural uploads are subject to sub-atomic integrity checks.
